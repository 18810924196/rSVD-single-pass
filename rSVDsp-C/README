The programs support the following paper:

Single-Pass PCA of Large High-Dimensional Data,
by Wenjian Yu, Yu Gu, Jian Li, Shenghua Liu, and Yaohang Li.

This program in C has been tested on a Linux system, with Inte C MKL library including BLAS and Lapack functions.

-------Instructions-------
To compile the codes, you must install the ICC Compiler and Intel MKL Library and set the proper environmental variables to use them. To do this, one must modify the script source_script.sh to reflect the location of the installation on your system (typically the root folder for icc can be determined via the command 'which icc'). To set variables, please execute:
'source source_script.sh'

Now verify that the ICC compiler can be called using:

'icc -v'

Once paths have been set, please execute

'./compile.sh'

If compile.sh is not marked executable, run 'chmod u+x compile.sh' prior to execution.

This should generate an excutable file called: rSVDsp_test.

The input test matrix should be a binary file on hard disk; matrix entry is respresneted by IEEE single-precision float number. The matrix is a dense matrix, stored in the row-by-row manner.
You shall specify the file name for the data, and other specifications in rsvd_test.c, and then compile the program.

(a small matrix: exp3_2E3_2E3.dat is attached for test)

Now, run it. You will see the comparison among our single-pass rSVD algorithm, and the basic two-pass randSVD algorithm and an existing single-pass rSVD algorithm in [Halko2011review].
